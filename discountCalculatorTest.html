/* Defining Table
 * Input: price
 * Processing: determine if subtotal is over 50 dollars
 *if over 50 determine if it is Tuesday or Wednesday
 *if tuesday or wednesday and over 50 then apply a 10% discount
 *apply 6% sales tax to every amount put in
 * Output: final price
 

You work for a retail store that wants to increase sales on Tuesday and Wednesday which are the store’s slowest sales days.
Write a defining table and then a program that takes a customer’s subtotal as input and if the subtotal is greater than $50 and today is Tuesday or Wednesday,
subtracts 10% from the subtotal. Your program should then compute and output the total amount due by adding sales tax of 6% to the subtotal. Within your program,
use this JavaScript code that will get the current day of the week from your computer’s clock:

    var dayOfWeek = new Date().getDay();

If you use the above code, the variable dayOfWeek will hold 0 if today is Sunday, 1 if today is Monday, and so on to 6 if today is Saturday.

      if (sub >= 50 && (dayOfWeek == 2 || dayOfWeek == 3)){
         var finalPrice= (sub - sub * 1 / 10) * (6 / 10) + (sub - sub * (1 / 10));
